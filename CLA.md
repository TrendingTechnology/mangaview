# Contributor License Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, ARIYAMA Keiji must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ARIYAMA Keiji and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

If you have not already done so, please complete and submit:
